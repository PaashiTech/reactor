# Components > App

This directory contains the components which contain Unmaze-related business logic, but are used only in specific sections of the app.

e.g. List showing profile details of the user (profile section)

## App sections

App sections are logical divisions of the Unmaze app according to the functionalities they provide.
These do not correspond to the relative place they appear within the main navigation flow of the app.
Components are divided into following logical sections -

### Profile

1. Profile Details (list, list item)

### Family

1. TBD
