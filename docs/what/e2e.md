# E2E Tests

End-to-end testing is a technique that simulates real user actions and covers as much of your application's functionality as possible. Jest, Playwright and Detox are popular frameworks for end-to-end testing in web and mobile applications. They have some similarities and differences in how they write and run tests.
Some common patterns among these frameworks are:

- They use the describe and test (or it) syntax to structure the test suites and cases.
- They use the expect and toMatch (or toEqual) syntax to make assertions and verify the results.
- They use the beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach and afterEach hooks to set up and tear down the test environment and data.
- They use the page, element and by keywords to access and interact with the UI elements.
To extract the common pattern and reuse the tests across these frameworks, you can try the following steps:
- Write your tests using the describe, test, expect and toMatch syntax, which are supported by all three frameworks.
- Use the page, element and by keywords to access and interact with the UI elements, which are similar in Playwright and Detox. For Jest, you can use the react-native-testing-library or react-test-renderer to simulate the UI elements.
- Use the beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach and afterEach hooks to set up and tear down the test environment and data, which are supported by all three frameworks. For Playwright, you can also use the browser, context and page fixtures to manage the browser instances and contexts.
- Use conditional statements or environment variables to switch between the frameworks and their specific configurations, such as the browser type, device type, and launch options.
